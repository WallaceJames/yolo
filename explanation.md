# Explanation of Ansible Playbook

## Playbook Execution Order

The Ansible playbook is executed sequentially, with each play targeting specific groups of hosts. The order of execution is crucial to ensure that dependencies are handled correctly. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the execution order:

### 1. Role: `mongodb`

**Function**: 
- Installs and configures MongoDB on the database server.

**Positioning**:
- This role is executed first to ensure that MongoDB is up and running before any applications that depend on it are deployed.

**Ansible Modules Used**:
- `ansible.builtin.apt`: To install MongoDB.
- `ansible.builtin.systemd`: To ensure MongoDB service is started and enabled.

### 2. Role: `backend`

**Function**:
- Installs and configures the backend application on the backend server.
- Ensures that Node.js and application dependencies are installed and the backend service is running.

**Positioning**:
- This role is executed after the MongoDB role to ensure that the backend application can connect to the MongoDB instance.

**Ansible Modules Used**:
- `ansible.builtin.apt`: To install Node.js.
- `ansible.builtin.command`: To run `npm install` for application dependencies.
- `ansible.builtin.systemd`: To manage the backend service.

### 3. Role: `frontend`

**Function**:
- Installs and configures the frontend application on the frontend server.
- Ensures that Node.js and application dependencies are installed, and the frontend service is running.

**Positioning**:
- This role is executed after the backend role to ensure that the frontend application can properly interact with the backend services.

**Ansible Modules Used**:
- `ansible.builtin.apt`: To install Node.js.
- `ansible.builtin.command`: To run `npm install` for application dependencies.
- `ansible.builtin.systemd`: To manage the frontend service.

### 4. Role: `nginx`

**Function**:
- Configures Nginx as a load balancer or reverse proxy.
- Sets up the Nginx server with appropriate configurations to handle incoming traffic and distribute it to the backend services.

**Positioning**:
- This role is executed last to ensure that the backend and frontend services are up and running before Nginx is configured to route traffic to them.

**Ansible Modules Used**:
- `ansible.builtin.apt`: To install Nginx.
- `ansible.builtin.template`: To deploy the Nginx configuration using a Jinja2 template.
- `ansible.builtin.systemd`: To ensure Nginx service is started and enabled.

## Conclusion

The sequential execution of these roles ensures that the infrastructure is set up in a logical order, with each component relying on the proper configuration of the previous ones. This structured approach helps in managing dependencies effectively and ensures that all services are correctly initialized and operational.
